# DynamicWebAppsProject3
New version of the To Do-list done using jQuery framework.

The app takes user input and inserts it into a table. The user can mark the tasks as done and remove them. 
A counter below the table keeps track on how many tasks there are left to do. All user input is saved to browser localStorage.
